# MCP-study

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that analyzes GitHub Pull Requests and publishes structured insights to Notion.

This is a demo made with a [datacamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/mcp-model-context-protocol) to showcase MCP usage with Claude Desktop application.

It does the following:

- Fetch Pull Requests from GitHub by repo and PR number
- Extract metadata (title, author, timestamps, state) and file-level changes (additions, deletions, patches)
- Export analysis to Notion
- Run as a local MCP server, directly integrated with Claude Desktop
